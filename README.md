Project Codes

This repository was created with the exclusive purpose of publishing the tasks
which required any sort of coding/script in order to succesfully complete a college project.

For the MapReduce tasks there are two different sets of jobs - Driver, Mapper and Reducer:

(i) Querying data stored within HBase and writing the results in a new table also in HBase.
(ii) Querying data stored within HBase (referring to the results tables) and writing the results in HDFS to allow easy download.
